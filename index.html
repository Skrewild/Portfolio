                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I am from Uralsk, and now I am 19 years old. I graduated from Nazarbayev Intellectual School (NIS) 2 years ago, which was an important milestone in my educational journey. During my time at the school, I gained a solid foundation in various subjects and am proud of my academic achievements, including a 7.5 IELTS score and 1380 SAT score.</p>
                <p>Aside from my studies, I have many interests that keep me busy. I love reading—whether it's fiction, manga, or novels, I enjoy immersing myself in different stories and ideas. Gaming is another passion of mine; I find them a fun way to relax. That said, abandoning online gaming, I can say, “I chose to be happy.” I also enjoy hanging out with friends, as social connections are important to me. Math and algebra are my favorite subjects, and I have often participated in math olympiads. Additionally, I try to stay active by exercising, which helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle. I must admit that sometimes I can be a bit lazy, but I think it's all about balance. I believe in finding time to relax and have fun while still achieving my goals.</p>

                <p>In 2022, I participated in the Business Plan Competition with a team, where we proposed an innovative app development idea aimed at recycling food from cafes, restaurants, and bakeries. Our concept focused on reducing food waste by connecting surplus food from these establishments with consumers and organizations in need, promoting sustainability and community support. We achieved 3rd place in the competition.</p>
